I am working towards my CKA certification and this project uses minecraft bedrock server deployed in google cloud. Using GKE autopilot to create a Kubernetes cluster and then deploying the Splunk Otel collector to pull the logs from the pods and send them over HEC (http event collector) to Splunk Enterprise deployed in my homelab.
