I am working towards my CKA certification and this project uses minecraft bedrock server deployed in google cloud. I am using GKE autopilot to create a Kubernetes cluster. I am deploying the Splunk Otel collector pull the logs from the pods and send them over HEC (http event collector) to my homelab Splunk Enterprise deployment.
